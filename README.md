In here are my files for the module 10 challenge.
The work completed for the first part of this assignment is in "climate_dr".
The second part of this assignment is found in the "app.py" file.
I was able to connect to the database and run queries on it, while also analyzing the data found there.
I was able to make an app that created static and dynamic routes that returns jsonified data.
